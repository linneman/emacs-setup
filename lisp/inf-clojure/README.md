# Inf Clojure

This package provides basic interaction with a Clojure subprocess (REPL).

For a more powerful/full-featured solution see [CIDER][].

## Installation

Available on all major `package.el` community maintained repos -  [MELPA Stable][],
[MELPA][] and [Marmalade][] repos.

MELPA Stable and Marmalade are recommended as they have the latest stable version.
MELPA has a development snapshot for users who don't mind breakage but
don't want to run from a git checkout.

You can install `inf-clojure` using the following command:

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] inf-clojure [RET]</kbd>

or if you'd rather keep it in your dotfiles:

```el
(unless (package-installed-p 'inf-clojure)
  (package-refresh-contents))
```

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

<kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>

Add the following to your Emacs config to enable
`inf-clojure-minor-mode` for Clojure source buffers:

```el
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'inf-clojure-minor-mode)
```

## Usage

`M-x inf-clojure` or `C-c C-z` within a Clojure source file.

## Troubleshooting

### REPL not responsive in Windows OS

In Windows, the repl not returning anything. For example, `(+ 1 1)` and `ENTER`, the cursor just drops to new line and nothing shown.

The explanation of this problem and solution can be found here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leiningen/48M-xvcI2Ng . 

The solution is to create file named `.jline.rc` in your $HOME directory and write this line in that file.

`jline.terminal=unsupported`
